Projects and Experience
A few highlights from my work developing and deploying functional applications:
1. Personal Finance Telegram Bot
Technologies: Python, Telegram API, Google Sheets API, Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
Overview: I built an automated expense tracker that lets users log daily transactions via a simple chat interface.
Key Achievement: This system integrates the Google Sheets API for real-time data synchronization and financial reporting. I containerized and deployed the application on GCP to ensure reliable, continuous availability.
2. Abalone Mobile Game with AI Opponent
Technologies: Java, Android SDK, Q-Learning
Overview: I developed a complete Android version of the Abalone board game, including a custom game engine and an intuitive user interface.
Key Achievement: The game features a Q-learning reinforcement learning bot that learns by playing against itself, providing a dynamic and genuinely challenging difficulty curve for the user.
3. Computational Neuroscience Research
Technologies: Python, FSL, Computational Neuroscience
Overview: I performed in-depth data analysis on functional MRI (fMRI) data to study complex brain activity patterns within a Human Memory Lab.
Key Achievement: I developed optimized data processing pipelines that were critical for cognitive neuroscience research, ensuring the data was properly validated and prepared for advanced analysis.
Currently Exploring
I'm always learning. Right now, I'm diving into:
