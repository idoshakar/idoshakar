Hello, I'm Ido ShakartsiI'm an engineer focused on turning data and complex problems into working software. My background blends Software Development, Data Analysis, and Algorithm Design, giving me a solid foundation for building scalable systems and implementing robust data pipelines.I enjoy taking on computational challenges and have a particular interest in applying machine learning and signal processing principles across different technical domains.Technical Skills and ToolsI focus on core programming, data manipulation, and cloud infrastructure.CategorySkills & ToolsProgrammingPython, Java, C, C++, MATLAB, SQL, BashData & MLPandas, NumPy, Data Structures & Algorithms, Machine Learning, Signal Processing, fMRI AnalysisSystems & CloudGit, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), AWS, Docker, Linux, Database Systems, API IntegrationSpecializedObject-Oriented Programming (OOP), Computational NeuroscienceProjects and ExperienceA few highlights from my work developing and deploying functional applications:1. Personal Finance Telegram BotTechnologies: Python, Telegram API, Google Sheets API, Google Cloud Platform (GCP)Overview: I built an automated expense tracker that lets users log daily transactions via a simple chat interface.Key Achievement: This system integrates the Google Sheets API for real-time data synchronization and financial reporting. I containerized and deployed the application on GCP to ensure reliable, continuous availability.2. Abalone Mobile Game with AI OpponentTechnologies: Java, Android SDK, Q-LearningOverview: I developed a complete Android version of the Abalone board game, including a custom game engine and an intuitive user interface.Key Achievement: The game features a Q-learning reinforcement learning bot that learns by playing against itself, providing a dynamic and genuinely challenging difficulty curve for the user.3. Computational Neuroscience ResearchTechnologies: Python, FSL, Computational NeuroscienceOverview: I performed in-depth data analysis on functional MRI (fMRI) data to study complex brain activity patterns within a Human Memory Lab.Key Achievement: I developed optimized data processing pipelines that were critical for cognitive neuroscience research, ensuring the data was properly validated and prepared for advanced analysis.Currently ExploringI'm always learning. Right now, I'm diving into:Advanced distributed computing patterns.Applying reinforcement learning to real-world optimization problems.Connect with MeContactDetailsEmailidoshakar@gmail.comLinkedInhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/ido-shakartsi-a7469a255/
